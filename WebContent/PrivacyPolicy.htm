<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the official 
privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) of OpenEntry, and forms part of 
the Terms of Use and together with 
any Additional Terms, forms your agreement with us. Any capitalized 
terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth 
in the Terms of Use. This Privacy 
Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or 
participation in the Site or any particular Site Service, feature, function 
or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, 
ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This Privacy Policy 
governs only the Information collected by us on the Site and does not 
cover any other information, whether collected in any other manner or

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You may choose to provide 
certain information to us when you use the Site. When we use the term

such as your full name, address, e-mail address or telephone number. 
When we use the term &quot;Additional Information&quot;, we mean any 
information that we collect on the Site about you or your use of the 
Site and the Site Services, other than Personal Information (Personal 
Information and Additional Information will be collectively referred

COLLECT</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keeping your Personal 
Information secure and ensuring your understanding of how we use and 
maintain your Personal Information is important to us.  OpenEntry maintains 
physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal 
Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% 
secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially 
reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A. <b>User Registration. </b>
We collect information about you when you create an OpenEntry Catalog 
account and enter or input Personal Information, whether during the 
course of entering, initiating, fulfilling and transmitting Personal 
Information or otherwise in connection with your general activities 
and/or use of the Site. We may use Information to tailor your experience 
at our Site, to display content we think may be of interest you, or 
to let us customize what you see when you visit the Site according to 
your preferences.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">B. <b>Site Features 
and Functions. </b>Information that you disclose and which may be saved 
on the OpenEntry Catalog account is used to provide the Site Services 
to you and other members, and to administer our business, the Site, 
and our Site Services in a manner consistent with the Terms of Use as 
well as all applicable laws, rules, regulations and other legal obligations.  
We may from time to time, transfer or merge your Information to our 
off-line databases and/or store such Information in an electronic format 
as well as combine your Information with information available from 
other sources.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">C. <b>Communications.</b> 
Sometimes we may use Information to advise you of products or Site Services 
that may be available through OpenEntry or its affiliates.  We may ALWAYS 
contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, 
including (a) follow-up messages regarding the administration of products 
or Site Services you indicated an interest in, (b) products or Site 
Services you have selected or purchased or (c) other transactions you 
have initiated in connection with our Site.  However, you may choose 
to “opt-out” (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) 
of marketing and promotional emails by clicking the link provided in 
the email itself</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. </font></p>
<ul><p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2. SHARING AND 
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION</b></font></p></ul>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A. <b>General Disclosure. </b>
We will not use any of your Personal Information for any purpose other 
than to provide the Site Services, and as set forth in the Terms of 
Use, unless we provide advance 
notice to you of any other use.  We will not share your Personal Information 
with any non-affiliated parties, unless you “opt-in”, except as 
otherwise stated within the Terms of Use or as otherwise necessary to 
provide the Site Services.  We will share your Personal Information with 
our operational service providers that assist in delivering our Site 
Services to you.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">B. <b>Accuracy. </b>
You are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal 
Information and we have the right to refuse or revoke your right to 
use our Site and Site Services and/or reject and delete any entry you 
make if we have reason to believe that the Personal Information you 
provide to us is or may be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this 
Privacy Policy or in violation of the Terms of Use.  If you are submitting Personal Information on behalf 
of others in your business for registration purposes or otherwise, you 
represent that you have their permission, agreement and full authorization 
to provide this Personal Information to us for these purposes.  We reserve 
the right to ask you to provide evidence of that at any time during, 
or even after, the submission process or to contact those individuals 
to confirm this at any time.  If we determine that such authorization 
has not been properly obtained, we may immediately and without notice, 
discontinue your use of those features of our Site and Site Services.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">C. <b>Third Parties. </b>
Although your privacy is very important to us, in this legal and technical 
environment, we cannot fully ensure that your Personal Information will 
not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be compelled 
to disclose your Information to a governmental agency or a court; or 
third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
communications.  Additionally, we may (and you authorize us to do so) 
disclose any of your Information to private entities, law enforcement 
or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe 
necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems 
or inquiries or to protect our own business and assets. In such circumstances, 
we will, where possible, require such third parties to maintain the 
confidentiality of any information so disclosed. <a name="0.2_OLE_LINK10"></a>In addition, 
if OpenEntry sells all or part of its business, or makes a sale or transfer 
of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in 
a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, OpenEntry may 
transfer your Information to the party or parties involved in the transaction 
as part of that transaction.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Site may contain 
links to websites and services owned or maintained by third parties. 
We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and 
data collection policies and practices implemented by such third parties, 
some of which may be substantially different from our corresponding 
policies and practices.  OpenEntry has no obligation and is not liable 
for the treatment or maintenance of any information, content, data or 
materials transmitted, distributed or otherwise provided by you via 
any such third party websites or services.  It is your sole responsibility 
to review their respective policies and practices and determine whether 
the same are adequate.</font></p>

THROUGH AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your Internet browser 
has a feature called “cookies”.  A cookie is a small piece of information 
that is stored in your browser by a web server.  OpenEntry catalogs have 
cookies to track the origin of referrals.  Cookies can only be read by 
the Site that placed the cookie on the hard drive of your PC.  However, 
cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give 
us Personal Information.  You do not need to have cookies turned on to 
visit our Site, although active participation in the referral system 
may require cookies.  In addition, you may elect not to allow cookies 
to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser.</font></p>
