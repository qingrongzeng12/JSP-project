<p style="max-width: 540px;">The OpenEntry Network Market Management System enables business networks to manage their network markets comprised of the catalogs of their members.  Therefore any company that wants to participate in any network market first needs to register its catalog onto the Network Market Management System.  And then anytime they update their catalog, they need to remember to also update their information on the Network Market Management System server.</p>
