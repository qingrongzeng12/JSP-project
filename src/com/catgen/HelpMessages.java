		message[Constants.CATEGORIES]="Categories<br/>=======<br/><br/>Use of category allow search of products belonging to that category. There are two components in Network Market homepage from where category based product search can be carried out. <br/><br/>- One, there is a category dropdown (Optional. Category based search can be customized from the 'Style' page) on the search panel in the Network Market. Visitors to a Network Market website can perform a search by selecting a category from the category dropdown box and clicking on the search button.<br/><br/>- Two, there is an optional Category sidebar that can be placed in the Network Market website. This can be enabled/disabled from the 'Style' screen. Category sidebar allows one-click-search of products belonging to that category, which is the only difference from the search panel based search.<br/><br/>Categories can be defined using this screen. A category consists of two parts:<br/>1. Category Value: A category value is the description/string that is visible to the user.<br/>2. Category Key: This is the string upon which the search is actually carried out.<br/><br/>The motive behind having both category key and value is that the string by which the search is actually carried out may not always be the same as the string that is to be displayed to the user. Eg. If 'Exquisite jewelry' is the cateogry value and 'jewelry' is the category key, 'Exquisite jewelry' will be visible to the user, and when a search is carried out by selecting/clicking 'Exquisite jewelry', a search is performed using the key 'jewelry', as there might not be exact matches with the string 'Exquisite Jewelry'.<br/><br/>The 'Category' screen consists of two sections:<br/><br/>1. Existing Categories:<br/>This displays the list of all the defined categories. There is a provision to remove a category by clicking on the (X) button next to the category in this list. By default, there is one category definition with Category Value 'All Categories' and blank value of category key so as to perform blank search, or to search all the products when an all category search is performed.<br/><br/>2. Add a new category:<br/>This allows adding a new category. You can add category key and category value in the respective text fields, and click on the 'Add Category' button. After clicking on the button, the category will be enlisted in the Existing Categories section.";
		message[Constants.STYLE]="Style<br/>====<br/><br/>Using this screen, you can customize the look-and-feel of your Network Market website.

Font color field has a color chooser.<br/><br/>Screen / Page / Nav Bar / Title Bar / Category (Background/Title/List/Hover) Background Properties:<br/>Background property includes-<br/>(a) Background Color:<br/>- Color chooser available.<br/>(b) Background Image:<br/>- Upload image somewhere else, and specify image url(only.

If none are available, default color will be applied.<br/>(c) Tile Direction:<br/>- The image will be tiled (repeated) in mentioned direction(s). X will tile it horizonally; Y vertically, and XY will tile it in both directions to fill the space. If you select NONE, the image will not be repeated in any direction.<br/><br/>Text Customization:<br/>This is to enable site to be displayed in various languages. Default values are populated in English for all texts except 'Home', which will therefore not be displayed in the Navbar unless a text is specified. Combination of these texts will be used to generate compound word string. Eg. In Spanish, &quot;productos&quot; and &quot;que no se encuentra&quot; stand for &quot;Products&quot; and &quot;Not found&quot;. If these customized texts are entered in respective fields, it will display &quot;productos que no se encuentra&quot; when no products are found. Similarly, &quot;Destacados&quot; stands for &quot;Featured&quot; in Spanish. So when &quot;Destacados&quot; is entered as customized text in place of &quot;Featured&quot;, it will display &quot;Destacados Productos&quot; in place of &quot;Featured Products&quot; in the title bar of Network Market homepage.<a href=\"http://75.101.165.126/mcc3\">mcc3</a> is a good example to understand the usage of text customization.<br/><br/>Search Customization:<br/>You can enable display of Country search dropdown, Category search dropdown and Price search dropdown from here by selecting the radio button. You can also define &quot;default search text&quot; from here. By default, &quot;Enter Keyword&quot; is displayed in the textfield in the search panel in network market webpage. The search button image can also be customized from here(URL only. No HTML here)<br/><br/>Search Result Display:<br/>Search result is displayed as a grid of product image thumbnails. The number of images in a row and column, along with the dimension (width and height) can also be specified from here. You can also specify the thumbnail background color and text color. By default, a red button labeled &quot;Order&quot; is displayed below the product image. This can be customized by entering the url (No html support here) in the field that says &quot;Order Button Image URL&quot;.<br/><br/>Misc URL:<br/>- &quot;Featured Vendor Trust Seal&quot; Image URL: The 'vendors' page in the network market website displays the list of all associated vendors. The featured vendors have a trust seal logo in front of their name. This seal might differ with different Network Markets. This can be customized by entering the url to the trust-seal image (no html here). The image has to be of correct size(small) otherwise, it will affect the display in the vendors page. A default trust seal image is present.<br/>- &quot;No Product Image&quot; URL: Link to image to be displayed when no product is available.<br/><br/>Category Sidebar Customization:<br/>Incorporating a sidebar (left/right) or not (NONE) can be customized from here. Other font and background properties are given above.";
		message[Constants.REQUEST_ADD]="REQUEST ADD<br/>============<br/><br/>There are several ways a vendor can get more market exposure:<br/><br/>- Getting associated with a Network Market. This way, the vendor's products will be available to the Network Market, and the relevant products will be listed in search results.<br/>- Having the Network Market feature the vendor's products. This way, the featured products will be available on the Network Market's homepage.<br/>- Getting a trust seal, or being featured by the Network Market. The Network Market lists down featured vendors along with trust seal logo in the 'Vendors' page, and also gives more priority to the vendors' products during searches than to the products of the non-featured vendors.<br/><br/>'Request Add' helps a vendor get more exposure as mentioned in the first point above.
